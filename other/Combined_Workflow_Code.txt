# Algorithm for Identifying Research Findings from Files

## Scoring Criteria

A file is scored based on several criteria, with a minimum score of 4 needed to be classified as a research finding:

### Major Deductions
1. **-8 points** if the filename contains the words `"plan"` or `"guide"` (automatically disqualifies the file).

### Filename Score
1. **+1 point** if any keyword is found in the filename.
2. **Additional +2 points** if one of the first three priority keywords is found: `"research"`, `"findings"`, or `"report"`.

### Content Score (for non-PDF files)
1. **+1 point** if any content marker is found in the file.
2. **Additional +2 points** if one of the first three priority markers is found: `"Research Findings"`, `"Study Results"`, or `"Research Goals"`.

### Path Score
1. **+1 point** for each matching keyword found in the file path.

## Classification Rules

1. **Files scoring ≥ 4 points** are classified as research findings.
2. **Files with priority matches** in both the filename and content will always qualify (minimum **6 points**).
3. **Files with "plan" or "guide"** in the filename will never qualify (maximum possible score would be negative due to the **-8 deduction**).

## Example Scenarios

1. **File Name:** `research_findings.md`
   - **Filename Score:** +3 (priority keyword match)
   - **Content Score:** +3 (priority content marker match)
   - **Total Score:** 6 points → **Is a finding**.

2. **File Name:** `project_plan.md`
   - **Filename Score:** -8 (contains "plan")
   - **Content Score:** Possible matches
   - **Total Score:** Negative → **Not a finding**.

3. **File Name:** `summary_notes.md`
   - **Filename Score:** +1 (generic match)
   - **Content Score:** +1 (generic content marker match)
   - **Path Score:** Depends on matching keywords
   - **Total Score:** Depends on total → **Maybe a finding**.
