Dr. Smith at the VA clinic in Phoenix was very helpful with my medication issues.
I waited 3 hours before John Williams finally called me back about my benefits claim.
The nurse practitioner Mary Jane Johnson took time to explain everything clearly.
My experience with Sgt. Rodriguez during my transition assistance was outstanding.
I was disappointed that Ms. Sarah O'Malley-Smith didn't follow up as promised.
When I called about my appointment, Robert told me I needed to bring different paperwork.
The physical therapist (David Lee, I think) showed me exercises that really helped my back pain.
I would like to thank Nguyen from the front desk for going above and beyond.
My VSO J.R. Thompson helped me navigate the claims process efficiently.
I'm grateful to both Dr. Li and Nurse Washington for their exceptional care.
