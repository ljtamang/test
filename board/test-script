The fundamental issue is the same as the retrieval limitation test. RAG systems struggle with this question not because they can't perform mathematical operations, but because:

They typically retrieve only a subset of relevant documents rather than all matching records
They perform semantic matching rather than exact structured data filtering (for dates and facility names)
If even one relevant record is missed in retrieval, the calculations will be incorrect
RAG systems aren't designed for database-like operations that require complete data retrieval
