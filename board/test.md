Conclusion on RAG Capabilities
Based on the structure of these questions, we expect RAG to perform well on:

Finding specific information based on keywords
Identifying topics associated with specific facilities or programs
Extracting sentiment-based insights
Making text-based comparisons
Recognizing patterns in comments

RAG will likely struggle with:

Counting total records across the entire dataset
Performing min/max/average calculations
Comparing numerical values across different groupings
Analyzing correlations between variables
Identifying time-based trends

This capability assessment will help your technical leadership understand where RAG excels (information retrieval and understanding) and where it has limitations (mathematical computations and data aggregation) when working with structured VA survey data.
