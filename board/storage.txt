Subject: Clarification on Codespaces Access Policy

Hello IT Team,

When attempting to use Codespaces with [REPO NAME], I encounter:
"Codespace access limited. An unexpected error occurred."

Could you please:

1. Confirm if Codespaces are enabled for my role?
2. Share any policy documentation?
3. Advise on approved development alternatives?

Thank you for your assistance.
