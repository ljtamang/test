First-Time Upload:

Clone the GitHub repo and identify target files.

Store metadata for all target files in the Databricks table with upload_status = "Pending".

Upload all target files to Azure Storage.

Update the metadata table with upload_status = "Uploaded" and set the upload_timestamp.

Incremental Upload:

Periodically clone the GitHub repo and identify new or modified target files.

Compare the last_modified timestamp of files in the repo with the metadata in the Databricks table.

Upload only new or modified files to Azure Storage.

Update the metadata table for the newly uploaded files.
